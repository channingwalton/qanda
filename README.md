# Questions and Answers

At a recent project, my team produced a questionnaire customers needed to fill in to open bank accounts. 
It supported a number of different types of questions, with validation rules and a mechanism to establish
how _complete_ the questionnaire was.

It became apparent that this is not as straightforward as it first seems _if you want a type-safe, extensible model_.
Everyone felt certain there was a better way. This project is an exploration of different ways to model the problem.

## The Problem

The model must support the following:

1. Questions whose answers are of different types: Strings, Dates, Booleans, Address, Phone Number, etc. Note that these are not all primitives.
2. Questions can be optional but if answered must confirm to validation rules
3. The model must support questions with multiple Answers - eg. set of phone numbers, address history
4. A measure of how complete the questionnaire is - all non-optional questions must be answered without validation errors
5. Arbitrary validation rules such as:
  * string longer than a certain length
  * number greater than or less than another number
  * inter-question validation:
    * the current address does not match the address you gave on your identity document
    * You haven't given at least 3 years address history
  * essentially an arbitrarily complex expression for a question using its current answer _and_ any other answer
6. Given a list of questions of different types, produce different representations of the questionnaire:
  * pretty print
  * UI components (as HTML)
  * JSon
  * all the protocols

## Oh, and one more thing â€¦

Your model should be open to extension. That is, solve the [expression problem](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/expression/expression.txt):

# Contributions

I, and several others would be very interested to see solutions. So please send pull requests, just add a new package containing
code of course, and some documentation.
