# Questions and Answers

At a recent project, my team produced a questionnaire customers needed to fill in to open bank accounts. 
It supported a number of different types of questions, with validation rules and a mechanism to establish
how _complete_ the questionnaire was.

It became apparent that this is not as straightforward as it first seems _if you want a type-safe, extensible model_.
Everyone felt certain there was a better way.

This project is an exploration of different ways to model the problem, and also has a more complete and usable implementation.

For details of the problem see the README.md in the _experimental_ module. 

For the more usable library see the _questionnaire_ module.

# Contributions

I, and several others would be very interested to see solutions. So please send pull requests, just add a new package containing
code of course, and some documentation.
